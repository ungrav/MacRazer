/// Waits for the mouse itself to say something: a movement, a click, a wheel tick. Those
/// arrive as HID input reports, and macOS delivers them to any process with Input Monitoring
/// without taking the device away from the system, so the pointer keeps working normally.
///
/// This is the one thing the OS will tell us about a wireless mouse that the dongle won't. A
/// mouse asleep behind its dongle looks exactly like a mouse that is off: the dongle stays
/// enumerated and answers commands on its behalf with a timeout, and no notification fires
/// when the mouse comes back. Polling is the fallback for that, and it deliberately backs off
/// while the mouse stays away (see `BatteryPollStateMachine.Cadence`) — so without this, a
/// mouse that woke up sat unnoticed until the next poll.
///
/// Reports follow movement, so silence proves nothing and this never reports a disconnect.
/// It is a wake-up signal only, and a coarse one: it fires for any Razer mouse, so the caller
/// treats it as "look now", never as "the mouse is back". The battery read that follows is
/// what decides.
///
/// Only run while the mouse is unreachable. A mouse in use produces a hundred or more reports
/// a second, and waking this process for each of them would cost far more than the polling
/// this app just stopped doing.
///
/// Main thread only, like the run loop it schedules on: IOKit delivers the reports there
/// because that is the run loop the devices are scheduled on, and every method is called from
/// there too. `@unchecked Sendable` states that discipline, the same as `HIDMonitor`.
